Project Title:
The Global Collection of Disastrous First Dates

Project Overview:
This project is an interactive platform where users can submit, view, and vote on the most cringeworthy, embarrassing, or downright disastrous first date stories. The lists will be tailored to each user based on their preferences—whether they want to hear about date fails in a specific city, category (like "Restaurant Fails" or "Online Date Gone Wrong"), or simply the funniest ones. Each user can contribute their own horror story and rate others’ tales. It’s an engaging way to share laughs, learn from others’ misadventures, and connect over shared awkward experiences.

Key Features:
1. User authentication and login/logout with password security (hashing, JWT).  
2. Personalized list of first date stories based on user input or location.  
3. Users can submit, read, rate, and comment on date stories.  
4. Search and filtering capabilities (e.g., by worst category, location, or ratings).  
5. "Add Your Own Disaster" feature where users can share their own cringeworthy stories.  
6. Admin panel to moderate and add/edit stories.  
7. Users can upvote or downvote stories based on their hilarity or cringeworthiness.  
8. Ability to display random or "Story of the Day" through a background job.  
9. Integration with a basic recommendation system (e.g., similar stories based on ratings).  
10. Deployment of backend API and frontend with React.  
11. Option to implement a leaderboard for "Most Voted Stories" and "Most Embarrassing Date."
